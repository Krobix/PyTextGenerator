# PyTextGenerator
An "AI" (it is not an actual AI) that I developed in python. It will take text from a file and use what it knows from those words to generate text from it. Note that it is not very smart and will often just repeat the same word over and over if it cannot find anything.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Type the training data in story.txt. Then, go into the py file for the config options:

startwords - enter strings of any word that the output can start with

length - the length of space-seperated words that the output will produce (including the start word).
